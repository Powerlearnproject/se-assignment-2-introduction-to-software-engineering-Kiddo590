Q1
Software Engineering is an engineering approach to software development

Q2
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined approach to developing software, focusing on design, development, testing, and maintenance. It's about building large, complex systems. Traditional programming, on the other hand, is more about writing code for individual applications without the broader system-level perspective.
Q3
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used in software engineering to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software¹. It involves several stages:
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis: Gathering customer inputs and market surveys to design the basic project.
2. Defining Requirements: Specifying all the requirements for the software using Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
3. Design: Creating the software architecture.
4. Development: Writing and compiling the code.
5. Testing: Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is free of bugs.
6. Deployment: Releasing the software to the public.
7. Maintenance: Regularly updating and improving the software.
This approach ensures the end product meets customer expectations and fits within the overall budget

Q4
Agile: This model is renowned for its flexibility and adaptability. It operates on iterative progress through small, manageable units of work. Agile focuses on delivering work in iterations and increments, and adapting to change. It prizes rapid iteration, autonomy, and flexibility.
Waterfall: This model is loved for its structured progression. It adopts a linear and sequential approach, where each project phase must be completed before the next one begins. Waterfall is particularly useful for large, complex projects with very specific and unchanging requiremenT
Q5
Agile and Waterfall are two different approaches to software development:

Agile is flexible and adaptable, focusing on iterative progress through small, manageable units of work. It’s ideal for projects with changing requirements or when the end product is not fully defined.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It’s suitable for large, complex projects with specific, unchanging requirements.
Requirements Engineering (RE) is a systematic process used in software development to define, document, and maintain requirements1234. It involves the detailed gathering of both functional and non-functional requirements from various stakeholders1234. The RE process encompasses several distinct phases1234:

Feasibility Study: Assesses whether the project should proceed by examining the proposed system’s technical, economic, legal, operational, and schedule feasibility1234.
Requirement Elicitation and Analysis: Involves gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders

Q6
Requirements Engineering (RE) is a systematic process used in software development to define, document, and maintain requirements. It involves gathering both functional and non-functional requirements from various stakeholders. The RE process includes several phases:

Feasibility Study: Evaluates whether the project should proceed by examining the proposed system’s technical, economic, legal, operational, and schedule feasibility.
Requirement Elicitation and Analysis: Involves gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders.
Software Requirement Specification: Translates the requirements into a standardized format.
Software Requirement Validation: Ensures that the requirements reflect the system that the client desire

Q5
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, loosely coupled modules. Each module performs a specific function and interacts through well-defined interfaces. This approach improves maintainability by making the code easier to understand and update, and enhances scalability by allowing easy addition of new features12.

Software Testing is the process of evaluating a software product to ensure it functions as intended, is free of bugs, and meets user requirements. It’s a critical step in the software development lifecycle that helps deliver high-quality, reliable software3.
